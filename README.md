# Notes: ComfyUI Websites/Resources

Trying to compile a list of things to follow to keep up with the latest
workflows/nodes/models (also related generative technology).

For discords, just hang in there for announcements. Some discords, have a
channel for new novel workflows, so you can turn notifications on for those.
Recommended to mute the rest of the discord, unless you decide to participate.
